## Module Overview

This module provides APIs to generate and inspect UUIDs (Universally unique identifier).

The UUIDs are generated based on the [RFC 4122](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122.html) standard. Other operations include validating a given UUID string and getting the version of a UUID string.

For information on the operations, which you can perform with the uuid module, see the below **Functions**.
